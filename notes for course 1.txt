First of all, I need a structure for this project.

What we need to do is to optimize a portfolio ratio in different stocks.

1. read into different stocks
2. have a model, let's say, calculate the index
3. plot the stocks timeseries
4. optimize the coef

Several index: cumulative return
               average daily return
               Sharpe Ratio
